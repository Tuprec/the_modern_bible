            <h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
            <p>"Using our app is simple and intuitive. When you open the app, you'll be presented with a search bar
                where you can enter a specific Bible verse or simply tap the 'Random' button to get a random
                verse. If you want to search for a verse related to a specific book, you can specify the book in the
                search options.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've entered your desired verse or chosen the random option, you'll be redirected to another page
                where you'll find an intriguing twist. Instead of seeing a picture of a wanted person from the FBI API
                assigned to the verse, you'll encounter a captivating anime art image. This unexpected fusion adds a
                touch of creativity and excitement to your exploration of the verses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, each time you access a verse, you'll also be treated to a random anime quote, which adds an
                extra element of inspiration and entertainment. If you want to customize your anime art experience, you
                can set tags to filter the type of art you prefer. These tags will be applied when you search for a
                specific verse or use the random feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enjoy the unique combination of Bible verses, wanted persons, captivating anime art, and inspiring anime quotes in our
                app. It's a delightful way to engage with scripture while discovering the beauty of anime art and the
                wisdom of anime quotes."</p>
